## Scaling Up Plan

- Cloud Resources: Utilize cloud services for auto-scaling compute and storage.
- Databricks Scaling: Enable auto-scaling for efficient resource management.
- Containerization: Use Docker and Kubernetes for scalable and portable deployments.
- Distributed Processing: Implement Apache Spark to handle large datasets.
- Real-time Processing: Use tools like Apache Kafka for real-time data streams.
- Version Control: Track models and experiments using MLflow.

## Security Plan

- Encryption: Encrypt data in transit and at rest using SSL/TLS.
- Access Control: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure data access.
- Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up data and test recovery processes.
- Input Validation: Implement strong input validation to prevent injection attacks.
